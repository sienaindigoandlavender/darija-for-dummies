## What is Darija?

Darija (الدارجة) is Moroccan Arabic — the mother tongue of 40 million Moroccans. It is distinct from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA/Fusha) and largely unintelligible to speakers of Gulf, Levantine, or Egyptian Arabic. Darija absorbs heavily from Amazigh (Berber), French, Spanish, and increasingly English.

Darija is NOT taught in Moroccan schools (which teach MSA and French). It has no official written standard. There is no Académie for Darija. People text using a creative Latin-Arabic hybrid where numbers replace Arabic sounds: 3 = ain (ع), 7 = emphatic h (ح), 9 = emphatic s (ص).

## The Sound System

Darija has sounds that do not exist in European languages:

- 3 (ain / ع): pharyngeal constriction, the signature Arabic sound
- 7/hh (ha / ح): forceful aspirated H, deeper than English H
- 9/ss (sad / ص): emphatic S with tongue pressed flat
- gh (ghain / غ): voiced uvular fricative, like French R
- kh (kha / خ): voiceless uvular fricative, like Scottish "loch"
- q (qaf / ق): uvular stop, a K from the very back of the throat
- dd (dad / ض): emphatic D
- tt (ta / ط): emphatic T

Darija drops most short vowels from Classical Arabic. "Kitaab" becomes "ktab." This creates dense consonant clusters.

## Grammar Essentials

### Pronouns
ana (I), nta (you m), nti (you f), huwwa (he), hiya (she), hhna (we), ntuma (you pl), huma (they)

### Possession: dyal + suffix
dyali (mine), dyalk (yours), dyalu (his), dyalha (hers), dyalna (ours), dyalkum (yours pl), dyalhum (theirs)

### Verb Tenses
- Present: ka- + conjugated root (ka-nakl = I eat)
- Past: root + person suffix (klit = I ate)
- Future: ghadi + present without ka- (ghadi nakl = I will eat)

### Negation: ma...sh
Wrap any verb: ma-ka-naklsh (I don't eat), ma-klitsh (I didn't eat), ma-ghadi-naklsh (I won't eat)

### Question Words
wash (yes/no), shnu (what), fin (where), fuqash (when), 3lash (why), kifash (how), shkun (who), bshhal (how much)

## Key Cultural Concepts

### Hshuma (حشومة) — Social shame/boundary
The invisible fence around acceptable behavior. Not religious — cultural. Eating with left hand, arguing with parents publicly, arriving empty-handed.

### Niya (نية) — Pure intention
"3ndu n-niya" = someone with a pure heart who acts without calculation. The highest compliment in a culture where cunning is respected.

### Mktub (مكتوب) — It is written / destiny
Not fatalism — the deepest form of acceptance. When things go wrong: mktub. When wonderful things happen: also mktub.

### Baraka (بركة) — Divine blessing/abundance
A house, a person, a meal can have baraka. It's prosperity that comes from spiritual alignment, not effort alone.

## Essential Religious Phrases in Daily Speech

These are not performative religion — they are grammar:
- Inshallah (إن شاء الله) — God willing. Can mean yes, maybe, or never.
- Bismillah (بسم الله) — Before eating, entering, starting anything.
- L-hamdulillah (الحمد لله) — Always the first answer to "how are you?"
- Tbarkllah (تبارك الله) — Said to admire. Protects from evil eye.

## The Greeting Sequence

Moroccan greetings are social protocol, not optional pleasantries:
1. Assalamu 3alaykum — Peace upon you
2. Wa 3alaykum s-salam — And upon you peace
3. Labas 3lik? — Are you well?
4. Labas, l-hamdulillah — Fine, praise God
5. Kiddayr? — How are you doing?
6. L-3a2ila labas? — Family OK?
